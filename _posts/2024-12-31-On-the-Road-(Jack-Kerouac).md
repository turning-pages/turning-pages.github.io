## How I got my hand on this

Growing up, I never heard the name of Jack Kerouac. Being from somewhere where it was not a common household practice to read English books (_except if it was a classic_), Jack Kerouac was not really a name to exercise. Later in my late teens, when the world was slowly opening up to me, I came to know about the Hippie movement and their predecessors, "Beats". Names and works of people like Allen Ginsberg, Kerouac, and William S. Burroughs were flowing in the book circles and, as was the nature of the age, they were treated as "holy" — for lack of a better word. "On the Road" was always considered one of the defining books of the Beat Generation. It took me some time and the right moment to finally pick it up, but once I did, it was like jumping into a road trip that spanned decades and miles of imagination.

## The plot ... hmm ... in short

"On the Road" is less about a structured narrative and more about the journey — both literal and figurative. The story follows Sal Paradise, a stand-in for Kerouac himself, as he roams through the United States with his somewhat enigmatic and free-spirited friend Dean Moriarty. Their travels take them from New York to Denver, San Francisco, and beyond, meeting an array of colorful characters, experiencing fleeting romances, and engaging in deep (and sometimes drunken) soul-searching discussions. It’s a story of restless energy, of searching for meaning and connection in a post-war America that was rapidly changing. It's also a story of finding a meaning of life, trying to do something that is self-satisfying -- the appeal of this aspect is probably universal and timeless.

## The essence I got out of it

The book is more than just a travelogue; it’s an exploration of freedom, friendship, and the pursuit of authenticity. What struck me most was the raw, unfiltered prose — Kerouac’s unfiltered and freewheeling style of writing
pulls you right into the whirlwind of Sal and Dean’s adventures. It made me question the constructs of society and the choices we make in the name of stability ----- How much of this is only for the sake of keeping the tradition/society as it is, how much of it is even necessary, how much of this is actually blocking us. 

At its core, "On the Road" is about longing — for the open road, for the unknown, and for a life less ordinary. It’s raw, messy, chaotic, and often bittersweet, but isn’t that what life is?

## Other related materials I found

Reading `"On the Road"` opened up a rabbit hole of Beat literature and culture. I found myself drawn to Allen Ginsberg’s `"Howl"` and William S. Burroughs’s `"Naked Lunch"`. 

I was amazed by the fact that the first draft of this book was typed in a 37m long scroll made of tracing paper and glued together. That is piece is being exhibited in some museum now.

There are also several documentaries and films about Kerouac and the Beat Generation that offer more context about their lives and impact. Notably, the 2012 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337692/">film adaptation</a> of `"On the Road"` provides a visual take on the book, though it understandably lacks the same spontaneity as Kerouac’s prose. Personally I liked the style of the movie and I will go as far as saying that the movie is a thing on its own right.

There’s also a treasure trove of interviews and essays online that delve into Kerouac’s writing process and the book’s legacy.

## Should or shouldn't ...

Should you read `"On the Road"`? If you’ve ever felt the urge to pack a bag and hit the open road with no destination in mind, then absolutely! It’s not a book for everyone — the lack of a traditional plot and the often flawed characters might not resonate with all readers. But if you’re willing to embrace its imperfections, you’ll find a story that’s as much about self-discovery as it is about the journey itself. 

For me, it was a reminder to live with open mind, curiosity and to find peace in the chaos that is called life.

I recommend it wholeheartedly.

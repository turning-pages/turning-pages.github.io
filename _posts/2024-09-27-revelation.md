# Welcome to Turning Pages

Welcome to **Turning Pages**, a place where stories come alive and thoughts meander through the words of the books I read. This blog is a space to share the experience of diving into pages — sometimes emerging with awe, other times with questions, but always with something to reflect upon.

## Why Turning Pages?

Every book holds its own world, and every world has its own mysteries. Some stories stay with you, lingering like a song you can’t get out of your head, while others fade into the background. I’m here to talk about both — the unforgettable, the thought-provoking, and even the ones that didn’t quite resonate. Through my posts, I’ll share what spoke to me, the elements I loved, and the ones that left me wanting more.

## A Journey Through Stories

For some people, reading isn’t just a hobby; it’s an exploration. Each book is a journey, an opportunity to see the world through different eyes. As we will explore our interpretations and impressions, we also hope to introduce books — whether they share themes with ones in discussion or offer a fresh perspective on familiar ideas. Recommendations will be part of this journey, guiding you to your next favorite read.


So, without further ado, let’s begin...
